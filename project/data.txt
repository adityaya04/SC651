Summary :
This research paper introduces a novel nonlinear filter for addressing the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem using the matrix Lie group framework, incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and feature measurements for enhanced vehicle pose estimation and feature localization in a 3D space. The proposed filter leverages the geometric nonlinearity of SLAM dynamics within the Lie group of SLAM n(3), combining the benefits of direct operation on the group for increased accuracy and computational efficiency, with the integration of IMU data to counter unknown biases effectively. Through extensive simulation and theoretical analyses, the filter is shown to provide significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and convergence to true vehicle pose and feature locations over existing methods. This advancement marks a significant step forward in SLAM technology, offering a powerful tool for autonomous navigation and mapping applications.

Abstract : 
This paper introduces a novel computationally efficient nonlinear filter for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), designed to adeptly manage the intrinsic nonlinearities of SLAM problems. Operating on the Lie group SLAM n(3), this filter integrates measurements from group velocity vectors, feature measurements, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to enhance accuracy in localization and mapping. The development and application of this filter address the limitations faced by Gaussian filters in handling nonlinear dynamics, proposing an innovative approach that closely aligns with the SLAM's nonlinear nature. The filter improves upon previous methodologies by effectively compensating for unknown biases in the velocity measurements and employing gain mapping to handle cross-coupling between pose and feature innovations. Notably, the filter guarantees asymptotic convergence of error components and ensures the stability of the attitude error function. A comparative analysis with existing SLAM filters substantiates the proposed filter's superior performance. Through simulations, the filter demonstrated significant advancements in accurate localization and mapping across various applications, ranging from household to industrial scenarios such as security surveillance, mine exploration, and pipeline inspection. This work not only presents a groundbreaking nonlinear filter design for SLAM but also proves its effectiveness and applicability in diverse environments, marking a significant contribution to the field of robotics and autonomous navigation.
